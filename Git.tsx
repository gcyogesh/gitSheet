// to see what changes we made in git IT WILL SHOW ALL COMMIT YOU DID = git log   
// FOR CHECKOUT WHAT COMMIT YOU DID = git CHECKOUT (YOUR COMMIT ID)   TO GO TO MAIN branch (git checkout master);

// BRANCHES 
// git branch "branch-name"    // TO MAKE branch;
// .git branch    // TO SEE NUMBER OF branch;
// TO SWITCH INTO ANOTHER branch = git checkout "branch-name";

// TO MERGE branchES  = git merge <YOUR ANOTHER branch>
// ANOTHER WAY OF SWITCHING git branch  = git switch <branchNAME>

// TO CREATE, SWITCH , CHECKOUT branch AT ONCE = git checkout -B <NEW-branch>

// DELETE THE branch = git branch -d <branch-NAME> (SMALL d)

// IF YOU HAVE DATA INSIDE THAT branch AND YOU HAVE TO DELETE IT THEN = git branch -D <branch-NAME>  (CAPITAL D)

// TO REMOVE TRACKED FILES = git rm <FILE-NAME>   (if i alreay commit to git and i deleted from my folder we do this)

//TO KNOW THE FILES WE HAVE IN GIT =   git ls-files

//HOW TO HANDLE CHANGES WHICH WE ARE NOT TEND TO BE CHANGED = git restore --staged <file-name>   (Example: we did changes in gitignore file whilch
// is not needed and it's already git commited)

// WHAT IF YOU COMMITED THE WORK IN YOUR REPO AND MUST DELETE IT(THE LAST COMMIT) = git reset HEAD~1;       (NW)

// WHEN YOUR WORK IS NOT COMPLETED YET AND YOU DON'T WANT TO COMMIT THEM  = git stash
// IF YOU ARE RETURN FOR WORK AGAIN THEN = git stash apply
